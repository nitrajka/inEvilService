It's a game, written in Java. I made it as a project for one of my subjects at school.

You are a black sheep in a fold. There is a lot of white sheeps and shepherd dogs around you.
If you turn all of the white sheeps to the "dark side" you win. But don't let the shepherd dogs catch you.
Control the black sheep with arrows. To restart the game, let the dogs catch you and then press Enter.
